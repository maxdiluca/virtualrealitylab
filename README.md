# [Virtual Reality Lab](https://github.com/maxdiluca/virtualrealitylab)

This website is using the _Research Group Template_ from Hugo Blox, the following are useful things if you're looking to help maintain the website:

- [**Get Started**](https://hugoblox.com/hugo-themes/)
- [View the **documentation**](https://docs.hugoblox.com/)
- **Automatically import citations from BibTeX** with the [Hugo Academic CLI](https://github.com/GetRD/academic-file-converter)

The integrated [**Wowchemy**](https://hugoblox.com) website builder and CMS makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free. Edit your site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, light/dark themes, and language packs.

To run this within terminal do: `hugo server -D`
