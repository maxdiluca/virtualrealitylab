Hi, I am Karthika. 

I completed my bachelors degree in Electronics Engineering and worked in the industry for 5 years. I am back to studying now, pursuing my masters in CNCR at the University of Birmingham. I am interested in multisensory integration and neuroAI. I am working on **visuo-haptics integration** to assess softness in VR for my master's thesis at the lab.
