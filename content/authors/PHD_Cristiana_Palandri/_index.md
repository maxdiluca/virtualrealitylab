Hi, I am Cristiana Palandri, a composer and visual artist whose interdisciplinary practice ranges from music to drawing, installations to sculpture, and performance, conceived as interconnected stages of a unified narrative. My musical production explores both electronic and contemporary classical music, based on new technologies. 

I am currently in my third year of doctoral studies with a thesis entitled “Materializing sound-based composition: exploring multisensory perception and audience engagement” under the supervision of two composers, Prof. Peter Batchelor and John Young, and Prof. Massimiliano Di Luca.
