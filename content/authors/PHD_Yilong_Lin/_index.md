Hi, I'm Yilong Lin (林毅龙, Rayleigh), an HCI researcher.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, supervised by Prof. Eyal Ofek and Prof. Massimiliano Di Luca since September 2025.

I recently completed my master's degree in the School of Design at the Southern University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Seungwoo Je. I earned my B.S. from the South China University of Technology. I also gained valuable research experience as a visiting student researcher in the WIT LAB at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology under the supervision of Prof. Ian Oakley.

If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to send me an email!
