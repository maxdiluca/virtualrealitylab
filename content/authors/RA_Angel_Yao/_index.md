Hello! I'm a research assistant in the VR Lab.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences and a Master’s degree in Computer Science. My earlier work focused on healthcare and pathology, with hands-on experience in molecular laboratories and hospitals. Building on this foundation, I have worked on projects applying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to support molecular test development. 

I am currently working on projects involving motion analysis and human movement dynamics. My broader interests lie at the intersection of **human pathology and computer science**, particularly in using computational methods to analyze movement, performance, and health related outcomes at both the molecular and anatomical levels.
