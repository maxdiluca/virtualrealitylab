**Yuehang Lin is a Research Associate in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, working with the VR Lab on research spanning virtual reality, haptic feedback, human–computer interaction, and computer vision. His work focuses on how immersive technologies and tactile cues can enhance user perception and behaviour within virtual environments.**
Beyond software development, Yuehang is experienced in hardware engineering and 3D-printed prototyping. He has designed and fabricated fingertip haptic devices, sensor mounts, and circuit systems tailored to experimental requirements. His hardware-related experience includes contributing to an interactive crystal music installation, developing prototypes for the ASD Precision Pinch Reaction Apparatus, and integrating various Arduino-based haptic devices. These projects have strengthened his understanding of hybrid systems that bridge hardware and interactive software.
During his postgraduate final project, Yuehang worked on Haptic Slip Rendering for Improved Grasp Stability in VR Teleoperation, developing a closed-loop system that combined Unity simulation, custom-built haptic devices, and serial communication. This project deepened his interest in tactile perception, grasp physics, and multimodal interactions in VR.
He currently supports the lab and academic staff on multiple interdisciplinary XR projects, including the Immersive Projection Conference System, aiming to develop interactive technologies that seamlessly connect virtual and physical experiences.
